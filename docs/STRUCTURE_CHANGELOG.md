# Structure changelog

Every new top-level folder, new app, or significant architectural change
gets an entry here, newest first — this is the traceability log the notes
asked for, separate from git history so it reads as a narrative instead of
a diff.

## 2026-08-26 — Initial scaffold

- Created the monorepo root `NutriBoost/` at
  `D:\PROYECTOS PERSONALES\NutriBoost` (previous working directory,
  `D:\download`, was Downloads — not a real project location).
- Added `docs/` with `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `HOSTING.md`,
  `COLOR_PALETTE.md`, `NAMING.md`, `AI_WORKFLOW.md`, `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`,
  `PENDING_IDEAS.md`, `errors/`.
- Scaffolded `client-frontend/`: Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4,
  shadcn/ui ("Nova" preset — Radix + Lucide + Geist), `react-router-dom`,
  `motion`, `i18next` + `react-i18next`.
  - Built `Navbar` (responsive: horizontal nav ≥ md, `Sheet` drawer below),
    `Footer`, a placeholder `Home` page, and a `ThemeProvider` (light
    default, dark-mode CSS variables already wired but not yet exposed to
    users).
  - Chose a green brand accent (`--primary`/`--accent`/`--ring`, hue 150)
    over shadcn's default neutral-only palette — see
    [COLOR_PALETTE.md](COLOR_PALETTE.md).
- `client-backend/`, `admin-frontend/`, `admin-backend/` **not yet
  scaffolded** — see [PENDING_IDEAS.md](PENDING_IDEAS.md). `client-backend`
  is scaffolded as soon as the .NET 8 SDK install (kicked off this session)
  finishes.
- Root `docker-compose.yml` added for local Postgres (Docker Desktop is
  installed on this machine but was not running — start it before
  `docker compose up`).
- `scripts/start-dev.ps1` / `scripts/stop-dev.ps1` plus two Desktop
  shortcuts added, per the notes' request to not have to reopen everything
  by hand each time.
- `widget/` added: a minimal local HTML/JS pending-vs-done tracker,
  minimizable, opened alongside the dev environment by `start-dev.ps1` —
  see its own README for why it's a lightweight web widget rather than a
  native tray app (scope tradeoff, revisit if it's not enough later).
